# oil-field-modelling
The toolbox for the oil fields modelling and analysis (oil forecasting, seismic slices classification, etc)

The cases folder contains jupiter notebook seismic_inversion.ipynb. Notebook shows how to convert a segy file to numpy.array format, perform an inversion operation on the resulting data, 
and prepare training and validation data sets of seimic time slices images. 
The CNN baseline model for binary image classification is also implemented.
